# # Simulation-Based Experiment: How Does Network Topology Affect Spreading?
# 
# In this notebook, we will design and run a **simulation-based experiment** to understand
# how **network structure** influences the spread of a contagion (e.g., an epidemic or idea).
# 
# This follows the steps discussed in the lecture:
# 
# 1. Define the research question — *How does network topology affect spreading?*
# 2. Choose models of network structure.
# 3. Define the spreading process (SIR model).
# 4. Decide on parameters and initial conditions.
# 5. Run simulations for different network types.
# 6. Measure quantities of interest (e.g. epidemic size, duration).
# 7. Compare results and draw conclusions.

# ## 2. Define network models
# 
# We will generate three classic network topologies:
# 
# - **Erdős–Rényi (ER)**: random connections between nodes (homogeneous degree distribution).  
# - **Watts–Strogatz (WS)**: small-world networks with clustering and short path lengths.  
# - **Barabási–Albert (BA)**: scale-free networks with hubs (heterogeneous degrees).  
# 
# These represent increasing levels of structure and heterogeneity in connectivity.

# ## 3. Define the SIR spreading process
# 
# The **SIR model** simulates how nodes transition through three states:
# 
# - **S**usceptible  
# - **I**nfected  
# - **R**ecovered  
# 
# Parameters:
# - `beta`: probability of transmission per contact per time step  
# - `mu`: probability of recovery per infected node per time step  
# 
# At each time step:
# - Infected nodes may transmit the infection to susceptible neighbors.
# - Infected nodes may recover with probability `mu`.

# ## 7. Discussion
# 
# **Observations:**
# - Epidemics on **Barabási–Albert** networks tend to reach a larger fraction of nodes and at lower β, reflecting the *vanishing epidemic threshold* in scale-free topologies.
# - **Watts–Strogatz** networks can sustain faster spread than random networks due to small-world shortcuts.
# - **Erdős–Rényi** networks require higher β to reach global outbreaks.
# 
# **Takeaway:**
# Network structure — degree heterogeneity, clustering, and path length — fundamentally shapes spreading outcomes.  
# Simulations allow us to explore these mechanisms systematically when analytical approaches are infeasible.

s allow us to explore these mechanisms systematically when analytical approaches are infeasible.
